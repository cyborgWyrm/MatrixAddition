answer the following question:

Q1: One of the goals of multi-threading
is to minimize the resource usage, such
as memory and processor cycles. In three
sentences, explain how multi-threaded
code accomplishes this goal. Consider
writing about blocking on I/O, multicore 
machines, how sluggish humans are,
threads compared to processes, etcetera,
and connect these issues to 
multi-threading.

		For part 1 you need to create both of the above classes.
		1.	In the main method of Main, instantiate four ThreadOperation objects, start them, and join them. Each ThreadOperation will take as input (through the constructor) two matrices and a quadrant indicator. The indicator could be a String, an int, an enum or a set of indexes. Itâ€™s up to you.

		2.	In Main.java, write a static method named print2dArray that takes a two-dimensional array as input and prints it out with the rows and columns lined up. You must use System.out.printf.

		3.	Instantiate a test 2d array with any values you like in main and use it to verify that print2dArray works.

		4.	The filename should be given through the command prompt and passed into main via String[] args

		5.	Open and connect to the file using a Scanner.

		6.	Read in the number of rows and columns and save these in local variables in main.

		7.	Read in the first and second matrices (two-dimensional arrays) from the file. I recommend writing a method to accomplish this task and calling the method twice (once for each matrix). Consider using this method header: 


		public static int[][] matrixFromFile(int rows, int columns, Scanner file_reader)

		NOTE: if you are using a static scanner or an object-oriented approach then you may not need to pass these arguments to the method.
